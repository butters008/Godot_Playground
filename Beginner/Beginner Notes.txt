Beginner notes:
Trying to learn Godot to a point where I feel like I can actually develop in it.

-- HELPFUL NOTES ------------------------------------------------------------
- In the scene tab (top right by default), click on the chain icon and it will bring
in a scene that you choose


Nodes - The building blocks of Godot, everything inside a "scene" is constructed of node
Scene - Everything is a scene that is construct from nodes, and you can put scenes inside of scene, to build
		characters, levels, design, and ect
		
Delta - This makes the game run at the framerate for the computer, regardless of fps of the comptuer

Movement:
	- Make sure you have the actions in the input map in the project settings
	
Nodes
	- 2 ways to target nodes
		1) get_node("node_path")
		2) $node path <- going to be using this one more I guess, in clear code at least
	- You can also give nodes unique names
	- You can capture a node in code, and access all the properties and methods
		- Think of them like classes/objects
