Beginner notes:
Trying to learn Godot to a point where I feel like I can actually develop in it.

-- HELPFUL NOTES ------------------------------------------------------------
- In the scene tab (top right by default), click on the chain icon and it will bring
in a scene that you choose
- You can change node types by right clicking on node and selecting change type in the
drop down menu that appears



Nodes - The building blocks of Godot, everything inside a "scene" is constructed of node
Scene - Everything is a scene that is construct from nodes, and you can put scenes inside of scene, to build
		characters, levels, design, and ect
		
Delta - This makes the game run at the framerate for the computer, regardless of fps of the comptuer

Movement:
	- Make sure you have the actions in the input map in the project settings
	
Nodes
	- 2 ways to target nodes
		1) get_node("node_path")
		2) $node path <- going to be using this one more I guess, in clear code at least
	- You can also give nodes unique names
	- You can capture a node in code, and access all the properties and methods
		- Think of them like classes/objects
	
2D Nodes - Physics
- Area2: An area that can check if another body entered 
	- Can be moved by changing the position
	- Example: Check if the player entered a house
- StaticBody2D: A static body that others bodies collide with
	- Not supposed to move
	- Example: Any static objects, walls, beds, obstables...
- RigidBody2D: Moving body that moves via physics (Like a cannon ball!)
	- Set an initial velocity
	- Example: The gernade
- CharacterBody2D: Moving body controlled by code
	- Inbuilt methods
	- Example: An entity that is controlled by code: the player and all enemies
