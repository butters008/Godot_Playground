Beginner notes:
Trying to learn Godot to a point where I feel like I can actually develop in it.

Nodes - The building blocks of Godot, everything inside a "scene" is constructed of node
Scene - Everything is a scene that is construct from nodes, and you can put scenes inside of scene, to build
		characters, levels, design, and ect
